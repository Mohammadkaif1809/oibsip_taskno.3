This code creates a simple Tkinter GUI with options to customize the password generation process. You can customize the password length and choose to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. The generated password can be copied to the clipboard with the "Copy to Clipboard" button.

Make sure to install the pyperclip module if you haven't already
